## Argument Markers
- I am tall, so I am good at sports - argument
- So can be a conclusion marker. Alternatives: because, therefore, thus, hence, accordingly.
- I am tall, and I am good at words - non argument
- I am good at sports because I am tall. I am tall is the reason.
- Because is a reason/premise marker. Alternatives: for, as, for the reason, and the reason why, since.
- When you can substitute because it's a reason marker. When you can substitute therefore, it's a conclusion marker.
- If is not an argument marker.
- What's more - is also a premise marker - it shows that another premise is coming.

## Standard form
- Premise, Premise, line, three dots, conclusion, number them.
- (1) I am a professor
---
- &there4; I teach classes (from 1)

## A problem for arguments
- If the premise is not justified you cannot justify the conclusion.
- Skeptical regress - any premise needs another argument to justify it, therefore you'll need endless arguments.
- Some solution that are not a good solutions:
  - Start with a premise that is unjustified
  - Use an argument with a circular structure
  - Use an infinite chain of arguments
- The better solution is:
  - Assure the audience - Use shared beliefs and assumptions - Example: You want a reliable car, so get a Honda. Assumes Honda are known to be reliable.
  - Discount objections - They had some reliability issues, oh, that was minor.
  - Guard the claim - they should be reliable in general.

## Assuring
- "I assure you, that smoking is bad for your health."
- "Everybody knows that smoking is bad for your health."
- Those sentences try to get you to accept the premise without a reason.
- Types of assurances
  - Authoritative - The surgeon general showed that it's bad for your health
  - Reflexible - myself - I believe that, I feel sure about...
  - Abusive - Nobody but a fool would think that. Conditional abuse that applies if you don't agree. Also: it's just common sense.
- Why we need authorities? since we don't have too much time to question everything.
- Tricks with assurances:
  - Citations of untrustworthy sources
  - Distractions - it's obvious. i'm sure.
  - Dropping assurances and making them assumptions
- We want an assurance when:
  - Someone might question the claim
  - The audience accepts the authority
  - It would be too much trouble to cite all the evidence.
- Assurance are not necessary when:
  - No one would question the claim anyway
  - The authority is not trustworthy
  -  There's time to give the reason properly.
- How to test: Try to replace the assurance word with "I assure you". To negate, try adding: "But I am not sure" to the end of the sentence

## Guarding
- We should not build any new nuclear power plants - because they will explode.
- How do you know that?
- So weaken the argument: We should not build any new nuclear power plants because some of them might explode.
- Is the issue justify the conclusion?
- How to guard?
  - Extent: We need a new alcohol officer on our campus because (all -> most -> many -> some) students drink too much.
  - Probability: It is (absolutely certain -> probably -> likely -> there's a chance -> he might have) that O.J simpson killed his wife.
  - Mental: I (know -> believe -> inclined to believe) the president is 50 years old

## Discounting
- Discounting is citing a possible criticism in order to reject it or counter it.
- This ring is expensive, but it is beautiful
  - It admits the ring is expensive
  - It asserts the ring is beautiful
  - It contrasts the two claims
  - It emphasizes the second claim about beauty
- But indicates the 2nd sentence is more important than the 1st sentence.
- Similarly: Although the ring is expensive, it is beautiful. Other words: However, Even if, even though, whereas, nevertheless, nonetheless, still
- Tricks:
  - Discounting straw man objections and not discounting the hard objections.
  - Combine discounting straw man with guarding and assuring. Example: The president is in favor of a public health service, but a public health service is not going to solve all of the medical problems of our people, therefore the president is on the wrong track.
  - When the above is used, counter by thinking which possible objections were left off the list.

## Evaluation
- My health care plan is good for the country.
- Making a preference (I like health plan) is not the same as making an evaluation (healthplan is good).
- Good can be interpreted as meeting the standard, bad as not meeting the standard
- Similar to assurance, we don't mention what the standards are.
- Types of evaluation terms:
  - General: Right and wrong, good and bad, ought and ought not.
  - Specific: Beautiful or ugly, Cruel or Kind, Brave or Coward.
  - Tricky / Contextually: Liberal or Conservative. These will not be considered evaluative language.
- Combining positive and negative words can change the meaning.
  - Good -> Good
  - Pretty Good -> Not as good
  - Pretty Darn Good -> Very Good
- Slanting - using evaluative words without a reason.
