## Week 3

### Validity
- In order to reconstruct an argument we need some standards for evaluating arguments
- What can go wrong in an argument?
  - One or more of the premises is false
  - The premise do not give a good reason for the conclusion.
- Good things in argument
  - Validity
  - Soundness
- Relationship between premise and conclusion:
  - In deductive argument, the conclusion should follow from the premise.
  - "follow from" is hard to classify so we use validity instead.
  - Inductive arguments do not need to follow validity.
  - **An argument is valid if it's not possible, that all premises are true and conclusion is false.**
- Validity does not mean that it's good.
- Validity does not depend on whether the premises or the conclusion are actually true
- Out of the four possible combinations of valid arguments: True/False Premise/Conclusion, the only one that is not possible is: True Premises, False conclusion.

### Soundness
- Argument is sound if premises are true and its valid (and so means that conclusion is true too).

### Stage 2 - Get Down to Basics
- Stage 2 of reconstructing an argument
- Step 2: Remove all excess verbiage
  - Remove repetitive premises
  - Road Markers - Saying what the issue is, why it's worth talking about - remove those too.
  - Tangent - do not provide reasons - remove those too.
  - Red Herring - Tangents with purpose of distracting you from the main argument.
  - Example - Specific examples do not support a general claim. Remove those too.
  - Sometimes its not so simple to remove terms, especially guarding terms.
  - Assuring terms are also tricky.
- What's left? explicit premises and concusion.
- Step 3: List argument in standard form

### Stage 3 - Sharpen Edges
- Step 4: Clarify conclusion and premises when needed
  - There's no easy way to know what needs to be clarified. Mostly it's words that can cause confusion to the listeners
  - When clarifying some words, that have few options of how to clarify them - choose the most charitable option.
- Step 5: Break up where possible without distortion
  - "and" is usually okay to break up, "or" is not.
  - Dependent clauses might aught to stay together.

### Stage 4 - Organizing Parts
- Step 5 - Divide the argument into sub arguments and arranging them in order.
- Linear Structure - Showed example of dividing an argument into premise -> conclusion. conclusion as premise -> 2nd conclusion.
- Branching Structure - There are two reasons for the conclusion and they form separate arguments.
- Joint structure - when two premises join together to make the conclusion (1+2 -> 3)

### Stage 5 - Fill in gaps
- Step 7 - Asses whether each argument is valid
- Step 8 - Add suppressed premises when needed
  - We all make assumptions and don't explicitly state them. Some of them are worth adding so we can assess them.
  - Adding when they help to understand the argument better
  - Types of suppressed premises:
    - Factual - Darwin & Lincoln example
    - Moral - Ought to respect mother example
    - Norm Based - Sabbath example
    - Linguistic - First cousin example

### Stage 6 - Conclude
- If you found a sound reconstruction, accept the conclusion
- If you try hard enough but fail, then it's reasonable to conclude that the argument is not sound.
    -
- Step 9 - Check each premise for truth
  - So we can have a sound argument.
- Step 10 - Qualify premises to make them true when needed if possible
