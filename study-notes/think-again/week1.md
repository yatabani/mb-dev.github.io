# Week 1 - How to Spot an Argument

## Why Arguments Matter
- Thinking in a new way and better way about what matters to you.
- Reasoning - how to find reasons for what we think and do.
- Understanding arguments leads to understanding reasons. And Good Arguments lead to Good Reasons for ways of thinking and behaving.
- Also, to avoid bad arguments such as sales people, religious evangelists and your friends trying to convince you to join a cross country trip and have a great time.

## What is an argument
- What are not arguments:
  - Fights. Arguments are not won by hitting someone in the head. Or yelling at someone. Or abusing someone by calling them names.
  - Contradiction. Disagreement is not an argument.
  - Predictions
- Argument is an intellectual process.
- Argument is connected series of statements [intended] to establish a definite proposition. (by Monty Python)
  - Dictionary or a novel also contain statements but their purpose is not to establish a proposition. The statements there are ordered chronologically or alphabetically.
- An Argument is:
  - a series of sentences, statements or propositions
  - where some are the premises
  - and one is the conclusion
  - where the premise are intended to give a reason for the conclusion.

## Uses for arguments
- **Persuading** - Making people believe or do something they would not otherwise believe or do. (Sales people)
- **Justification** - Giving someone a reason to believe the conclusion. (Giving reasons for buying a car, but you don't care about the outcome)
- To find the reason for argument ask:
  - Is the arguer trying to change someone's mind?
  - Is the arguer giving a reason to believe something?
- Understanding - Showing someone why I believe in something, regardless if they accept those reasons.
- Explain things - Giving a reason why something happened. Increase **understanding** of the reasons.
  - Aristotle gave 4 types of explanations:
  - **Causal** - why did the bridge collapse? an earthquake.
  - **Teleological** - the purpose - why did Joe go to the grocery store? to buy milk.
  - **Formal** - why does this peg not fit into the hole? The peg is square.
  - **Material** - Why is the golf club so light? it's made of graphite.
  - Explanations as a form of argument explain a general principle or law. They fit a phenomenon to a general pattern.

## Language arguments are made from
- Language is:
  - **Important**: We can't do much without language.
  - **Conventional**: We have patterns for using words and language and we criticize people who deviate from those conventions.
  - **Representational**: Changing words to mean different things, will not change the actual facts in the world. Declaring that socks are now called money, will not make you rich.
  - **Social**: Following the conventions are important so we can get what we want in a social setting.
- We can follow the rules of language without being aware of the rules. Learning some of those rules will help us understand arguments.
- Meaning - Meaning is how the word is used. Hello is used to greet people.
