# Week 1 - Intro
- The hebrew language was laying dormant for many decades and was not used.
- [Natan Zach - Rega Echad](http://www.soulandgone.com/2012/09/25/natan-zach-rega-echad/) - the song contains parts from historic hebrew.
- When Reuben sees the empty pit and says ["where shall I go?"](http://biblehub.com/commentaries/genesis/37-30.htm) - it rings similar to "please" in the song.

## Hebrew Language Rebirth
- The idea of the rebirth of the hebrew language is not completely accurate. It was used for prayers and Torah readings. It was just not a spoken language. It also had holiness attached to it and was not used.
- There was also hebrew of the Talmud - which is a different dimension.
- Throughout generations, Jewish people in different countries used Hebrew to communicate between them.
- There were also poems that were written in Hebrew. But they were used mostly for prayers.

## New Hebrew Poems vs. Englightment period
- Hayim Nahman Bialik and Tchernichovski
- [Bialik's - El Hatzipor](http://benyehuda.org/bialik/bia001.html) is one of the songs that starts this Era. It was meant to be sang in European Ashkenazi way of speaking.
- [Gordon - Kotzo Shel Yud](http://benyehuda.org/yalag/yalag_086.html) - is a much more important song - was part of the Haskalah movement - where songs were about ideas, culture and were meant to be used in a therapeutic view.
- The difference between Gordon and Bialik is that Bialik's song is more of an argument. There is no aesthetic beauty to it. It was more of a criticism to Jewish movement.
- Part of the Englightment - where man is the center of the universe instead of god. Similar to Humanism and scientific knowledge that stands opposed to traditional theological thinking.
- Today it is known that it's not so simple. Man vs. God is more complex. And scientific inquiry did not save humanity from cruelty and controlling governments.

## El Hatzipor
- Classism vs. Romanticism. Hebrew Classism is very intellectual, based on law. Romanticism means going to the soul instead of the mind.
- It's the first song that was meant to go together with the way words are pronounced.

## Chibat Tzion
- They wrote songs that influenced Bialik's songs.
- [Dulitzki - Shomer Ma Milelia](http://www.zemereshet.co.il/song.asp?id=2909)
- Mainly the idea that coming to Israel is related to the promise of redemption.
- Similar to [Hatikva](http://shironet.mako.co.il/artist?type=lyrics&lang=1&prfid=806&wrkid=4354), the word Kadima is also Kedem, word that signals the future and the past.
- [Mashiach - Frishman](http://benyehuda.org/frischmann/frisch001.html) Uses all enlightenment theatrics from Psalms to European Operas.
- Connects religious aspect to coming back to Isarel.
- Similar to the songs of "abba konstantin shapira", there are many emotional parts in Bialik's songs - suffering and cries. There are a lot emotions in the song which also came from Chibat Tzion.
- Bialik however, changes the emotional style in the song  [Dimaa Neemana](http://benyehuda.org/bialik/bia017.html)  to a more realistic proportions.
- Every generation pushes back on some concepts and adopts others.

## Terms
- [Romanticism][4] - Was part of a generation - in a pretty short time frame. Yet as an idea, it could be found in other eras.
- Was part of the french revolution and freedom. To freedom of mind and imagination. From thought to emotion, imagination and dreams captured the center of the discourse.
- Just like grand state of nature, so man was thought to be grand as well, which showed in art and music.
- [Nationalism][1] developed at the same time. Man belongs to a nation, a place and language.
- Longing is also getting mainstream during the  Romanticism.
- [Impressionism][3] are painters who rebelled against requirement to draw in a precise way. Where the focus moves from the painting to the visitor. [See also about Pointillism][5]
- [Modernism][2] - Change in the way of government - from kings, monarchs and fuedelism to political systems.
- [Postmodernism][6] - Questioning previous isms, questioning the enlightenment.
- In music, the writer controls the flow of reading, by ending each line at some lengths.
- [Chronobiology][7] - when it comes to music - the pace of the music
- [Metre][8] - counting verses and lines in the music.
- [Alliteration][9] - repeated sound of the first consonant in a series of multiple words
-  Two ways to make effects. 1) [Expressive][11]  2) [Onomatopoeia][10]
- Example: [Arik Einstein - Chivaron][12]
