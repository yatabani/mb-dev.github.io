# Week 2 - The Renaissance
- Movement from mind to emotion, and national ideas.
- This was hard to the jewish movement, therefore it criticizes it.
- One of the main ideas about nature - that nationalism is about nature and land.
- And the feeling that jewish life was divorced from nature.
- [Tsernichovski - No moments of sleeping in nature][1] - nature is a restless power, like romanticism, when i feel low, i go to the grand place of nature. When I go there, I feel shame.
- Nature as something to watch, to escape to appears in Russo, Shakespeare and others.
- [Tsernichovski - Before the statue of Apollo][2]
- Song conveys how the body - the source of beauty and nature is chained by tefillin.
- This kind of song was meant for Hebrew speakers, who studied in Yeshivot, understand the context and want to confront the now vs. tradition.
- [Tsernichovski - At Ko Reichaniya][3]
- A whole song about smell, the smell contains whole slew of parts of nature.
- Some words were added in these songs and they were sometime translated on the edges of the paper.
- [Tsernichovski - Levivot][4] - Example of Idyll song about a person getting connected to nature.
- Tsernichovski manages to create a feel good song that contains a lot of detailed description of natural items - washing cup, levivot all of those are described in great poetic level that is unprecedented in jewish thought.
