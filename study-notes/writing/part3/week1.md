- Is first person (I, me, or we) used, or is the writing impersonal?
- Is there a dominant type of sentence structure, such as the passive voice? (For example: "The experiment was done" not "We did the experiment.)

### Writing in Response to Reading

Interrogating text:

- Critical reading / reading purposefully.
- Preview:
  - Are there materials before the main reading? (introductions, overviews), why are they there? why they tell me?
  - Do you know the author? Is there info about the author?
- Ask questions as you read:
  - What does this mean? why does the writer draw the conclusion?
- Use in own words for main idea
- Create outline - lists main idea and sub points
- Summarize - after a chapter or short reading. Write what you understand the reading meant.
- Analyze:
  - Test logic, believability and impact
  - What I am asked to believe? facts? opinion?
  - Are there things that don't make sense?
  - Compare/Contrast - how does it compare to ideas before it?
  - How's my thinking changed as a result?

Note taking and annotating:

- Find a sentence that contains the main idea, highlight it.
- Do the same for other paragraphs.
- Read all highlighted areas and write summary of them.

Exercise - NYT article & annotate:

- What was the main idea of the article?
- What was your opinion of the article?
- Was there any part of the article you didn't understand?
- Was there any part of the article you disagreed with?
