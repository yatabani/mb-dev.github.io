# Reading in social sciences

**Goals:**

- read actively -
- identify the arguments
- weigh the evidence
- evaluate sources
- question assumptions
- identify biased information - is the author background influences how he/she sees the world

**Crituque vs. Criticize:**

- Criticize - to find fault with, to judge unfavorably or harshly.
- Critique - To review or analyze. A more neutral term.

**Four-step approach to reading and writing critically:**

- First Reading: Previewing
  - Skin a text quickly for the main ideas
  - Pay attention to the introduction
  - Read the opening sentences of paragraphs, and section headings
- Annotate & Analyze
  - Read more slowly this time, and take notes
  - Annotate - write notes, and most importantly, questions
  - Find the evidence and analyze / evaluate it
- Review:
  - Read a third time
  - Read your questions and notes
  - Look up unfamiliar words
  - Make sure you understand any confusing or complicated parts of the reading. Read it slowly to make sure you understand
- Respond in writing:
  - Freewrite - just write, what do you think about it? maybe with experiences you had?
  - Summarize - put in your own words, what were the main ideas
  - Outline - Write the main idea and supporting points in formal or informal outline.
  - Connect to other texts
  - Write a formal critique - Write an essay about what I just read from critical standpoint.
- Self Evaluate:
  - Think about what you've learned
  - Write more questions
  - Write what you still want to know
  - Do some research
