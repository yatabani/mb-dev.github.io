## Creative Writing

### Why read fiction?
- Two studies, published in 2006 and 2009, show that people who frequently read fiction are better able to understand other people, empathize with them
- novels, stories, and drama can help us understand social life

### Fiction Terms:
- Protagonist - main character
  - what kind of character is he or she?
  - what kind of problems does he face? (problems create tension and interest in the story)
  - What does he/she look like?
- Plot:
  - What happens?
  - Does the plot use surprise or tricks?
  - Is the ending happy or unhappy?
  - How does the author create suspense in the story?
  - How are the problems in the plot solved?
- Themes: Main idea, what the text is about.
  - Themes are usually a single word: love, hate, war, anger, peace
  - Ask what do you think the themes are?
  - Are they obvious or subtle?
  - Does the theme give you a new outlook?
- POV - who is telling the story
  - First person: I, or third person: he/she
  - Why the author choose this point of view?
- Symbols
  - Concrete object that represent an idea.
  - Example: Old oak tree might represent wisdom
  - Weather, seasons or settings might represent something.
- Humor and Irony
  - Irony - words intended meaning are different from their actual meaning.
  - Or a situation: Ends differently than what is expected or normal.
  - Does it contribute to the story or just makes the story more fun?
- Settings:
  - Time and place of the story
  - Is the setting necessary or the story could happen anywhere?
- How to respond to fiction
  - Freewrite
  - Goodreads
