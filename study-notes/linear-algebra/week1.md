# 1. The geometry of linear equations (1.1-2.1)

- How to solve n equations with n unknowns.
- Ax = b, A - coefficient matrix, x - unknown vector, b - the result.
- Linear combination of columns.
- Row picture: In 3d - each equation is a plane. Two of them meet in a line, three of them meet at a point.
- Column picture: Draw all vectors as columns.
- Solve Ax = b for every b.
- Multiply matrix by a vector by columns
- Multiply matrix by a vector by rows.

# 2. Elimination with matrices (2.2-2.3)

- solving 3 unknowns by elimination
- failure if there's zero in the pivot - use row exchange
- failure because 0=0 or 0!=0
- identity matrix
- using matrix to express elimination
- permutation matrix - exchange rows - multiply on the left.
- permutation matrix - exchange columns - multiply on the right.
- Inverse of matrix - matrix that gives identtiy
