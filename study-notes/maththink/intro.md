## Introduction
- Prior to the 1900 the main use of mathematics was for purposes related to money, and the emphasis was on calculations.
- In the past 100 years the focus shifted, to understanding the reasons, recognizing patterns, and adapting new mathematical methods.
- Precise and literal language is used in mathematics since they cannot assume common background and common understanding of the language.
