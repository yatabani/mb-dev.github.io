## Introduction
- Prior to the 1900 the main use of mathematics was for purposes related to money, and the emphasis was on calculations.
- In the past 100 years the focus shifted, to understanding the reasons, recognizing patterns, and adapting new mathematical methods.
- Precise and literal language is used in mathematics since they cannot assume common background and common understanding of the language.
- [Euclid's proof that there are many prime numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_theorem)
- [Guassian Integer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integer)

## Logical Combinators
- And is symbolized as ^ or &. (pi > 3) ^ (pi < 3.2) - conjunction.
- Conjunction -> a ^ b is the same as b ^ a - in math
- Exclusive or, one or the other, not both
- Inclusive or, either one or the other - in math - V symbol - disjunction.
