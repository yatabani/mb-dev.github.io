There are two Single Variable Calculus courses starting soon:

[EDX - Calculus 1A][1] starts in June 2 and split into 3 parts. Getting a verified certificate costs \$100 for each part, or \$300 in total. This course should be equivalent to [MIT 18.01][3] course.

[Coursera - Single Variable][2] starts in May 22. Getting a verified certificate costs \$50.

When it comes to books, MIT recommends [MIT - Calculus, Second Edition by Gilbert Strang][4]
