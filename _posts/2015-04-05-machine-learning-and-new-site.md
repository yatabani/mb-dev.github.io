I just finished taking the [Machine Learning][2] class from Coursera. I became interested in the topic while looking for information about recommender systems. Machine Learning as a topic, has been around for a while. The Machine Learning course came out in [2011][1], the New Yorker wrote about the topic at [2012][5] and [2013][6]. By now, [everyone is talking about it][7]. This morning I saw A Ted talk by [Fei Fei Li][4] about [How we're teaching computers to understand pictures][3]

There are so many excellent online courses available these days. [Scott Young][9] took a whole CS degree just by taking MIT courses online. This inspires me to get back to learn Linear Algebra and Calculus. I spent some time researching which courses are available, and compiled them [into a list](/resources/courses.html). I also added the list of courses i'm [planning to take][10] during 2015.

When taking classes online there's the question of how to take notes. I started taking notes on paper, until I stumbled upon [Nathan Typanski's blog][8] where he talks about using Latex and Markdown instead. Writing formulas in Latex can be time consuming  so I'm going back and fourth between taking screenshots of slides and using Latex.

If you are in San Francisco and taking online courses, i'm now part of the [Colearning: Study Group for Online Courses][11] meetup. Join us if you are around.
